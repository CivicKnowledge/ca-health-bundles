    summary: Birth Profiles by ZIP Code consist of the number of live births, based
        on the mother's residence at the time of delivery and include aggregates by
        Race/Ethnic Group of Mother, Age of Mother, Infant Birthweight, and Prenatal
        Care Trimester by ZIP Code.  These key health status indicators at the ZIP
        code level can be used to perform small area analysis to identify and target
        areas within cities and counties where public health programs may be needed.
