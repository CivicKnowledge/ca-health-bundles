<h1>Birth Profiles by Zip Code</h1>
<p>Birth Profiles by ZIP Code consist of the number of live births, based on the mother's residence at the time of delivery and include aggregates by Race/Ethnic Group of Mother, Age of Mother, Infant Birthweight, and Prenatal Care Trimester by ZIP Code.  These key health status indicators at the ZIP code level can be used to perform small area analysis to identify and target areas within cities and counties where public health programs may be needed.</p>
<h1>Caveats</h1>
<p>The birth profiles have two special zip codes for mssing values and low number cells:</p>
<ul>
<li>Zip 99998 collects the values for all cells in a column that are smaller than the lower number limit, which is documented for most years at 5. </li>
<li>Zip 99999 collects the values for all cells in a column for births where the mother's zip code is not known, or where the value is not "in the appropriate range."</li>
</ul>
<p>Values for <code>mother_age_lt29</code> are recorded only for the year 1995. </p>
<h1>File Footer Documentation</h1>
<p>These are the notes from the footers of each of the annual files. The footer text varies a bit from year to year, but is substantially similar across many years, so the following sections may have some differences with the fotters for specific years. </p>
