# Caveats

The birth profiles have two special zip codes for mssing values and low number cells:

* Zip 99998 collects the values for all cells in a column that are smaller than the lower number limit, which is documented for most years at 5. 
* Zip 99999 collects the values for all cells in a column for births where the mother's zip code is not known, or where the value is not "in the appropriate range."

Values for ``mother_age_lt29`` are recorded only for the year 1995. 


# File Footer Documentation

These are the notes from the footers of each of the annual files. The footer text varies a bit from year to year, but is substantially similar across many years, so the following sections may have some differences with the fotters for specific years.
