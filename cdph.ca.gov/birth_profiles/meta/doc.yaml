    main: "\n\n# Birth Profiles by Zip Code\n\nBirth Profiles by ZIP Code consist\
        \ of the number of live births, based on the mother's residence at the time\
        \ of delivery and include aggregates by Race/Ethnic Group of Mother, Age of\
        \ Mother, Infant Birthweight, and Prenatal Care Trimester by ZIP Code.  These\
        \ key health status indicators at the ZIP code level can be used to perform\
        \ small area analysis to identify and target areas within cities and counties\
        \ where public health programs may be needed.\n\n\n# County Birth Profiles\n\
        \nThe base data is provided from CDPH aggregated to zip codes. The ``birth_profile_county``\
        \ re-aggregates to counties, using the HUD zip code to county crosswalks.\
        \ These crosswalks link zip codes to the counties that contain them, and where\
        \ a zip code crosses a county bounty, the crosswalk provides the portion of\
        \ residential addresses that are contained in each of the counties. The births\
        \ are allocated to zip codes by the monther's zip code of residence, so while\
        \ the re-allocation is statistically sensible, it will most likely result\
        \ in different counts than if the original data were aggregated directly to\
        \ counties. \n\n\n# Caveats\n\nThe birth profiles have two special \"catchall\"\
        \ zip codes for mssing values and low number cells:\n\n* Zip 99998 collects\
        \ the values for all cells in a column that are smaller than the lower number\
        \ limit, which is documented for most years at 5. \n* Zip 99999 collects the\
        \ values for all cells in a column for births where the mother's zip code\
        \ is not known, or where the value is not \"in the appropriate range.\"\n\n\
        Values for ``mother_age_lt29`` are recorded only for the year 1995. However,\
        \ even though the <29 values would appear to overlap with the 20-29 age group,\
        \ summing all of the age columns produces the same value as the ``total_births``\
        \ column. Based on this, it appears that the ``mother_age_lt29`` coulmn is\
        \ just misnamed, and should be ``mother_age_lt20.``\n\nIn the catchall zip\
        \ codes ( 99998 and 99999 ) for year 2006, the sum of the four birth weight\
        \ columns does not equal the total_births column. \n\n\n\n# File Footer Documentation\n\
        \nThese are the notes from the footers of each of the annual files. The footer\
        \ text varies a bit from year to year, but is substantially similar across\
        \ many years, so the following sections may have some differences with the\
        \ fotters for specific years. \n\n## File Footer for Year 2000 to 2003\n \n\
