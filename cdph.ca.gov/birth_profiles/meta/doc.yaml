        \ of the number of live births, based on the mother's residence at the time\

        \ have two special zip codes for mssing values and low number cells:\n\n*\
        \ Zip 99998 collects the values for all cells in a column that are smaller\
        \ than the lower number limit, which is documented for most years at 5. \n\
        * Zip 99999 collects the values for all cells in a column for births where\
        \ the mother's zip code is not known, or where the value is not \"in the appropriate\
        \ range.\"\n\nValues for ``mother_age_lt29`` are recorded only for the year\
        \ 1995. \n\n\n# File Footer Documentation\n\nThese are the notes from the\
        \ footers of each of the annual files. The footer text varies a bit from year\
        \ to year, but is substantially similar across many years, so the following\
