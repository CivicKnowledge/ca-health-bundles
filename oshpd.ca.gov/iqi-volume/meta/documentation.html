<h1>Hospital Volume and Utilization Indicators</h1>
<p>of 11 Hospital Inpatient Quality Indicators (Inpatient Quality Indicators, Version 4.5) including 6 new subcategories (2 for Pancreatic Resection Volume and 4 for AAA Repair Volume) developed by the federal Agency for Healthcare Research and Quality (AHRQ) and provided by OSHPD for use by California consumers and health care providers.</p>
<h2>Notes</h2>
<p>Although the source of this data is OSHPD, the names of the hospitals don't link to the OSHPD facilities list. Instead, they are connected to the CDPH facilities list, from bundle cdph.ca.gov-facilities.</p>
