        of 11 Hospital Inpatient Quality Indicators (Inpatient Quality Indicators,
        Version 4.5) including 6 new subcategories (2 for Pancreatic Resection Volume
        and 4 for AAA Repair Volume) developed by the federal Agency for Healthcare
        Research and Quality (AHRQ) and provided by OSHPD for use by California consumers
        and health care providers.


        ## Notes


        Although the source of this data is OSHPD, the names of the hospitals don''t
        link to the OSHPD facilities list. Instead, they are connected to the CDPH
        facilities list, from bundle cdph.ca.gov-facilities.

        This bundle is currently broken, because the excel file sources are actually
        XML and are not zipped, and there doesn''t appear to be a Python library that
        can read the files. '
