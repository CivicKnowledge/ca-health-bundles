<h1>Patient Saftey Indicators</h1>
<p>Patient Safety Indicators (PSIs) are measures that represent rates of potentially-preventable adverse events that occur during a hospital stay. They provide a perspective on potential complications and errors resulting from a hospital admission and help assess total incidence within a region.</p>
<h2>Development Notes</h2>
<p>This bundle requires updating the sources manually, since the Excel files are too complex for manual processing. The 
Source can be automatically cached to the source store, but then it is converted to CSV manually. </p>
