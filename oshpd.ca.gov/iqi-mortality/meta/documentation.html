<h1>Inpatient Mortality Indicators</h1>
<p>The Inpatient Mortality Indicators (IMIs) are a subset of the AHRQ quality indicators that measure in-hospital mortality. They include medical conditions and procedures for which mortality rates may vary significantly across institutions. Evidence suggests that high mortality may be associated with deficiencies in the quality of hospital care provided.</p>
<h2>Notes</h2>
<p>Although the source of this data is OSHPD, the names of the hospitals don't link to the OSHPD facilities list. Instead, they are connected to the CDPH facilities list, from bundle cdph.ca.gov-facilities.</p>
