        # Inpatient Mortality Indicators


        The Inpatient Mortality Indicators (IMIs) are a subset of the AHRQ quality
        indicators that measure in-hospital mortality. They include medical conditions
        and procedures for which mortality rates may vary significantly across institutions.
        Evidence suggests that high mortality may be associated with deficiencies
        in the quality of hospital care provided.


        ## Notes


        Although the source of this data is OSHPD, the names of the hospitals don''t
        link exactly to the OSHPD facilities list. Instead, they are connected to
        the CDPH facilities list, from bundle cdph.ca.gov-facilities.


        However, they match well enough to the OSHPD list that nearly all of the entries
        can be assigned an OSHPD facility id. When the ``oshpod_id`` column is set
        from an inexact hospital name match, the name of the matched facility is stored
        in the ``matched_hospital_name`` column.
