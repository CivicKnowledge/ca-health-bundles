    summary: The Inpatient Mortality Indicators (IMIs) are a subset of the AHRQ quality
        indicators that measure in-hospital mortality. They include medical conditions
        and procedures for which mortality rates may vary significantly across institutions.
        Evidence suggests that high mortality may be associated with deficiencies
        in the quality of hospital care provided.
