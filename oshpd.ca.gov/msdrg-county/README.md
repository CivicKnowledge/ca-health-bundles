# Inpatient Hospital Discharges By County and Hospital, 2009 - 2013

An inpatient discharge record is submitted each time a patient is treated in a licensed general acute care hospital in California. These facilities report their discharge data via the Medical Information Reporting for California System (MIRCal). OSHPD has provided a custom extraction of the MIRCal system in two datasets; Medicare Severity-Diagnosis Related Group (MS-DRG) agregated to the county of the patient's residence, and the hospital from which the patient was discharged.
