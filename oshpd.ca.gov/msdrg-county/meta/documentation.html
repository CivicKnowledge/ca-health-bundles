<h1>Inpatient Hospital Discharges By County and Hospital, 2009 - 2013</h1>
<p>An inpatient discharge record is submitted each time a patient is treated in a licensed general acute care hospital in California. These facilities report their discharge data via the Medical Information Reporting for California System (MIRCal). OSHPD has provided a custom extraction of the MIRCal system in two datasets; Medicare Severity-Diagnosis Related Group (MS-DRG) agregated to the county of the patient's residence, and the hospital from which the patient was discharged. </p>
<p>These files were recieved in response to a data request to OSHPD, so there isn't any online documentation for them. The closest online resources, for datasets derived from the same database, are:</p>
