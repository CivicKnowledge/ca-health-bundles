    summary: 'An inpatient discharge record is submitted each time a patient is treated
        in a licensed general acute care hospital in California. These facilities
        report their discharge data via the Medical Information Reporting for California
        System (MIRCal). OSHPD has provided a custom extraction of the MIRCal system
        in two datasets; Medicare Severity-Diagnosis Related Group (MS-DRG) agregated
        to the county of the patient''s residence, and the hospital from which the
        patient was discharged. '
