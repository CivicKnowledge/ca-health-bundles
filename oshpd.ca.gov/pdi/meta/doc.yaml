        # Pediatric Quality Indicators (PDIs)


        Pediatric Quality Indicators (PDIs) use indicators from other AHRQ QI modules
        with adaptations for use among children. Similar to Prevention Quality Indicators,
        the PDIs identify hospital admissions that evidence suggests may have been
        avoided through access to high-quality outpatient care.
