    summary: Pediatric Quality Indicators (PDIs) use indicators from other AHRQ QI
        modules with adaptations for use among children. Similar to Prevention Quality
        Indicators, the PDIs identify hospital admissions that evidence suggests may
        have been avoided through access to high-quality outpatient care.
