pdd_puf,20,mdc,,,c03V0100k,VARCHAR,2,"Major Diagnostic Category (MDC). MDC code (for example, 22). The Major Diagnostic Categories (MDC) are formed by dividing all possible principal diagnoses (from ICD-9) into 25 mutually exclusive diagnosis groupings. The diagnoses in each MDC correspond to a single organ system or etiology and, in general, are associated with a particular medical specialty. MDC 1 to MDC 23 are grouped according to principal diagnosis. Patients are assigned to MDC 24 (Multiple Significant Trauma) with at least two significant trauma diagnosis codes (either as principal or secondary) from different body site categories. Patients assigned to MDC 25 (HIV Infections) must have a principal diagnosis of an HIV Infection or a principal diagnosis of a significant HIV related condition and a secondary diagnosis of an HIV Infection. Some discharges are associated with procedures that are resource intensive and may be associated with multiple diagnosis domains (for example, transplants, MS-DRG 001-017), or procedures that are unrelated to the principal diagnosis (MS-DRG 981-989). These records are assigned to a variety of MDCs, based on the principal diagnosis instead of the MDC associated with the designated DRG. A MDC of 00 is assigned to records that are ungroupable. Ungroupable records include those where the principal diagnosis is not an existing ICD-9-CM code or the sex code does not logically relate to the diagnosis or procedure. For a list of MDC codes and labels see Appendix I - Major Diagnostic Categories (MDC). Note that MDC codes and their associated labels potentially change across years and year-specific code-label crosswalk lists must be used."

MDC 1 to MDC 23 are grouped according to principal diagnosis. Patients are assigned to MDC 24 (Multiple Significant Trauma) with at least two significant trauma diagnosis codes (either as principal or secondary) from different body site categories. Patients assigned to MDC 25 (HIV Infections) must have a principal diagnosis of an HIV Infection or a principal diagnosis of a significant HIV related condition and a secondary diagnosis of an HIV Infection. Some discharges are associated with procedures that are resource intensive and may be associated with multiple diagnosis domains (for example, transplants, MS-DRG 001-017), or procedures that are unrelated to the principal diagnosis (MS-DRG 981-989). These records are assigned to a variety of MDCs, based on the principal diagnosis instead of the MDC associated with the designated DRG. A MDC of 00 is assigned to records that are ungroupable. Ungroupable records include those where the principal diagnosis is not an existing ICD-9-CM code or the sex code does not logically relate to the diagnosis or procedure.

Prepayments (e.g., deposits and prepaid admissions) are not deducted from Total Charges.
Total charges are reported in whole numbers and are rounded to the nearest thousand dollars ($1000). A zero amount is shown when the charges were less than $499.99, when there were no charges, when the charge is unknown, or when an invalid value is reported. Facilities with approved modifications to not report Total Charges are listed in Appendix C  Modifications and Exceptions. Total Charges of $9,999,999 indicates the actual charges exceed the maximum seven digit input field size. When a patient's length of stay is more than 1 year (365 days), only the last 365 days of charges are reported. Use the following formula to adjust total charges to reflect stays more than 1 year in length:
Adjusted Total Charges = (Total Charges / 365 days) x Length of Stay
