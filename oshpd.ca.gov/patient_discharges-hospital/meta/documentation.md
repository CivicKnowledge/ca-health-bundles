{about_summary}

The partition with the ``pdd_summary_msdrg`` table with no grain summarizes the counts for each MSDRG for the all years, while the partitions with the ``pdd_summary_msdrg`` and grains summarize counts for only the MDC in the name of the grain. Note that MS-DRG codes less than 20 and codes greater than 977 are not uniquely associated with MDC codes, so those MS-DRG codes may appear in multiple partitions.
