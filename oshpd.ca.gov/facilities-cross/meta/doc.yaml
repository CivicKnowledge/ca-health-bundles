    main: "\n# Licensed Facility Cross Walk\n\nThis dataset provides a simple cross\
        \ walk using Office of Statewide Health Planning and Development (OSHPD) assigned\
        \ licensed facility identification numbers linked with matched California\
        \ Department of Public Health (CDPH), Licensing and Certification facility\
        \ lists based on license number.  This is not a comprehensive matched list,\
        \ facility identification numbers that did not match are also included from\
        \ both the OSHPD and CDPH lists.  Facility Status or Facility Level designations\
        \ may explain some OSHPD non-matches, for additional information contact OSHPD\
        \ directly.  Please contact CDPH directly for more information regarding un-matched\
        \ facility identifiers that do not have corresponding OSHPD identifiers.\n\
        \n\n\nI used the following sources of data and included all records whether\
        \ matched or unmatched.  The Licensed Facility Listing Report for all types\
        \ of facilities (http://hfcis.cdph.ca.gov/Reports/GenerateReport.aspx?rpt=FacilityListing),\
        \ the CDPH Facility list that is on the Open Data Portal  (https://cdph.data.ca.gov/Facilities-and-Services/Healthcare-Facility-Locations/n8ju-ifrh)\
        \ and OSHPDs Licensed Facility Dimension table from our data warehouse (which\
        \ is more comprehensive than the facility lists on OSHPDs website -  http://www.oshpd.ca.gov/hid/Products/Listings.html)\
        \ and merged them together based on license number as a starting point.\n\
        \ \nI also added L&C Facility ID, Provider Number and address information,\
        \ all of OSHPDs identifying numbers, and OSHPDs facility level which helps\
        \ to identify the differences in the way L&C records facilities vs. the way\
        \ OSHPD does. I also included address and other geography.  The dataset is\
        \ sorted by OSHPD ID since it is an OSHPD product. Due to unmatched CDPH records\
        \ OSHPDs do not show in the list until row 3200.\nAs an example on row 3200\
        \ you'll see OSHPD Parent ID 106010735 - Alameda Hospital.  There are 12 record\
        \ combinations for this hospital, but only 3 physical locations, each having\
        \ the same OSHPD Parent ID and License number.  OSHPD recognizes 3 facility\
        \ locations, however, CDPH recognizes the SNF beds at the Clinton address\
        \ as a separate \"facility,\"  thus there is an extra record. OSHPD Facility\
        \ Level will help identify distinct facilities. \n \nJust by matching on address\
        \ across the lists you can see why it is so difficult to match across departments\
        \ or even across programs.  Differences in address, name, type of facility,\
        \ identifying numbers, etc. all lend to the multiple matches you will see\
        \ in the attached spreadsheet.  It's a daunting task you are attempting and\
        \ I wish you well. "

    summary: This dataset provides a simple cross walk using Office of Statewide Health
        Planning and Development (OSHPD) assigned licensed facility identification
        numbers linked with matched California Department of Public Health (CDPH),
        Licensing and Certification facility lists based on license number.  This
        is not a comprehensive matched list, facility identification numbers that
        did not match are also included from both the OSHPD and CDPH lists.  Facility
        Status or Facility Level designations may explain some OSHPD non-matches,
        for additional information contact OSHPD directly.  Please contact CDPH directly
        for more information regarding un-matched facility identifiers that do not
        have corresponding OSHPD identifiers.
