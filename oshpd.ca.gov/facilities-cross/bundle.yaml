    summary: This dataset provides a simple cross walk using Office of Statewide Health
        Planning and Development (OSHPD) assigned licensed facility identification
        numbers linked with matched California Department of Public Health (CDPH),
        Licensing and Certification facility lists based on license number.  This
        is not a comprehensive matched list, facility identification numbers that
        did not match are also included from both the OSHPD and CDPH lists.  Facility
        Status or Facility Level designations may explain some OSHPD non-matches,
        for additional information contact OSHPD directly.  Please contact CDPH directly
        for more information regarding un-matched facility identifiers that do not
        have corresponding OSHPD identifiers.
